# Amazon-Clone
# Developed By, GOWTHAM P
- This Amazon clone is a frontend web development project replicating core features of Amazon's user interface using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The responsive design adapts seamlessly across devices, featuring interactive elements like a functional shopping cart system, product search filter, and dynamic product cards with hover effects. The implementation includes key pages such as the homepage with promotional banners, product detail pages with image galleries, and a checkout process with form validation. While focusing on UI/UX replication, the project demonstrates modern CSS techniques including Flexbox, Grid, and animations, coupled with JavaScript for dynamic content updates and user interactions. Developed as a learning exercise, this clone emphasizes clean code structure and web development best practices, serving as a practical demonstration of building complex layouts and e-commerce functionalities without backend integration.
